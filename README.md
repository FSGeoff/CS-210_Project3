# CS-210 Project3

## The scenario for this program was to analyze the text records for a mock grocery store's items purchased throughout the day. Our assignment was to creeate a program that addressed the following three requirements for a given text-based input file that contains a list of purchased items for a single day.

- Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
- Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
- Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

### I was able to fufill all the requirements of the program and I obtained exemplory status on the histogram

### Although the histogram met all requirements, I created it using for loops, if/else statements, and a dictionary. I did not use the import of pandas or matplotlib which may have been more efficient.

### Finding a specific itme presented some challenges but the histogram was the most challenging. Agian, I was able to fufill the requirements without using the matplotlib which is used specifically for histograms. However I found an alternative means to produce the same results.

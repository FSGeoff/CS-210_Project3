### The scenario for this program was to analyze the text records for a mock grocery store's items purchased throughout the day. Our assignment was to creeate a program that addressed the following three requirements for a given text-based input file that contains a list of purchased items for a single day.

- Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
- Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
- Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

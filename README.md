# CS-210 Project3

## The scenario for this program was to analyze the text records for a mock grocery store's items purchased throughout the day. Our assignment was to creeate a program that addressed the following three requirements for a given text-based input file that contains a list of purchased items for a single day.

- Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
- Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
- Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

### I was able to fulfill all the requirements of the program, and I obtained exemplary status on the histogram.

### Although the histogram met all requirements, I created it using loops, if/else statements, and a dictionary. I did not use the import of pandas or matplotlib, which may have been more efficient.

### Finding a specific item presented some challenges, but the histogram was the most challenging. Again, I was able to fulfill the requirements without using matplotlib, which is used specifically for histograms. However, I found an alternative means to produce the same results.

### I'm coming to realize that integrating two different languages is very powerful. Utilizing the strength of each language allows you to address more detailed and complex solutions.

### The code is _readable_ due to descriptive variables and function names and has been commented on appropriately. The program is _adaptable_ as many different types of text files, such as CSV, can also be used to perform the same tasks. The code is _maintainable_ as another developer would be able to reuse and/or alter the code to fit their specifications.
